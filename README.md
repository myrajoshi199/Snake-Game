# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. The objective of the game is to control the snake using arrow keys and navigate it to eat apples, which causes the snake to grow longer. The player needs to avoid collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake's own body. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each apple eaten.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
- The snake will automatically move in the current direction.
- Try to eat as many apples as possible to increase your score and snake length.
- Avoid hitting the boundaries or the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.

## Features

- Smooth snake movement and control using arrow keys.
- Randomly generated apples for the snake to eat.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game over screen when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
- Colorful graphics and appealing visual effects.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing (for the graphical user interface)
